Intro
This repository is a basic CRUD Angular2 application, with an intention to learn Angular2 along with unit testing in it.

Software Prerequisites
In order to run this project, the following software is required

Git
See Setting Up Git from the GitHub guides.

Node.js and npm
Node.js and Node's package manager, npm, are used for installing dependencies, running the build steps, and running tests.

Getting Started
Begin by cloning the repository.

Use npm to get dependencies:

npm install

Take a look at the src folder. All application and test code are placed here. Typings configuration are also placed in this folder in tsconfig.json.

Build
The build step invokes the TypeScript compiler to create ES5 javascript files and source maps from the .ts files. Run with:

npm run build

You can examine the configuration for the TypeScript compiler in tsconfig.json. The generated files are output in the dist folder which provides as a destination to fetch pure Javascript files and also provides good separation of Typescript and Javascript files.

Serve
The app uses json-server to simulate client-server communication. Follow the GIT Repo to configure it to run on port 3000.

To see the app, run

npm run start

and navigate to localhost:3001.

Test
I used Karma with the Jasmine test framework to run unit tests. Try them with

npm run test

I have also used karma-coverage to generate the coverage report. The corresponding reports can be found under coverage directory.
